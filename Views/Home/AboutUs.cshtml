                <p>
                    Our market research reveals a striking disconnect between the cost of legal services and their
                    perceived value. A strong majority, 52% of Americans, believe legal services are simply too
                    expensive. This sentiment is underscored by our interviews with hundreds of legal professionals. The
                    findings are concerning: Big Law attorneys work grueling hours exceeding 70 per week, yet 18% of
                    their time goes uncompensated. Meanwhile, on the consumer side, 92% of low-income Americans report
                    dissatisfaction with the level of legal representation they received.
