                <p>
                    Strive's founding team recognized that the significant inefficiencies faced in both the client and
                    provider sides of the legal sector can be resolved via a simple two step process:
                    a) Improve pace to complete legal paperwork allowing attorneys to focus on relevant tasks like legal
                    discovery.
                    b) Empower clients with tools to make meetings with their attorneys objective and more productive.
                    By helping minimize the time spent on routine legal work we are helping lawyers apply their true
                    expertise to tasks they get best compensated for, like client consultations and case discovery.
                    Concurrently, through the use of our AI tools, clients can get expert insight and query specific
                    clauses directly from their documents. Clients can then use that knowledge to extract better
                    outcomes during their client-attorney meetings.

                <p>
                    Results from our market research found that 52% of Americans believe legal services are too
                    expensive, suggesting a disconnect between cost and perceived value.After hundreds of interviews
                    with practicing legal professionals, we learned- attorneys practicing in Big Law are working in
                    excess of 70 hours per week, while not being compensated for 18% of their hours worked. On the other
                    hand, 18% of legal consumers report being dissatisfied with their legal representation, implying a
                    mismatch between client expectations and delivered services.
