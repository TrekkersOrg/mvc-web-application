    <h2>Understanding Ontology in the Scope of Risk Management</h2>
    <p>
        Think of an ontology as a shared language for risk. It's a structured framework that defines the key players,
        relationships, and ideas involved in tackling risks. No more confusion over terms – everyone's on the same page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Building a comprehensive ontology supercharges your risk assessment. It streamlines the process, boosts
        communication, and ensures you're not missing any hidden threats. This means defining all the risk types, what
        causes them, how bad they could get, and how different factors interact.
    </p>
    <p>
        But ontologies don't stop there. They're the glue that connects your risk management across departments and
        systems. Imagine risk tools and methods that all speak the same language – that's the power of ontologies!
    </p>
        In a nutshell, an ontological approach to risk management brings clarity and structure, making your whole
        process more effective and efficient. It's like giving your risk management a major upgrade!
